## Part 1. Ingredients

### MILK 

> Milk was never meant to see the light of day"

- Sheep: highest in fat and proteins, strongest curd  
- Goat, Cow: weaker curd. Might need to add calcium chloride if the milk is overpasteurized or kept cold for too long

__Homogeneization__ reduces the size of fat particles -> poor cheesemaker milk  
__Pasteurization__ destroys lipase, affecting flavor, and denatures proteins, affecting coagulation and syneresis  
__Standardization__ helps balance the _Proteins + Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>_ to _Fat_ ratio. (E.g., _skimming_, for Parmigiano). Excess fat is lost when cutting the curd in the vat (still retained if ladled, like double crème Brie) 

Stress of any kind lowers milk quality. E.g., subclinical mastitis, detectable as increased leukocytes in milk.
 
_Yield_ = 1.63 * (%fat + %proteins)  
Up to 40% for soft cheese

### RENNET

- _Fermented_  
Animal genes expressed by bacteria  
- _Microbial_ (mucor miehei enzymes)  
They're even less retained than animal rennet  
- _Animal_  
Avoid

Single strength: 1ml coagulates 5L of milk (200 IMCU)

### CULTURES

- __Starter__  
Direct, Mother, Bulk, Whey  
- __Native__  
Clabbered cheeses. Today it's less feasible, but Devonshire clotted cheese and Schmierkäse rely on native cultures  
- __Ripening__  
Blue and white molds, propionic bacteria that produce eyes  

| Mesophile lactobacilli <40°C  | Properties
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------
| L lactis 	   		|  
| C cremoris       		| Sensitive to salt and temperature
| D diacetylactis  		| Fast
| M mesenteroides 		| It produces gas and diacetyl, flavoring

Cultures affect important flavoring molecules: L-, D-lactate, CO₂, ethanol, acetate, diacetyl, citrate. Bacteriophage infestations are a problem  

| Termophile lactobacilli <55°C | Properties
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------
| T Termophilus 	   	| Versatile. Fast or slow
| B Bulgaricus       		| ->Acid. Semi-hard, hard cheeses
| BL Bulgaricus Lactis  	| ->Acid. Semi-hard, hard cheeses
| H Helveticus 			| ->Acid. Semi-hard, hard cheeses
| BC casei 			| ->Acid and aroma. Found in raw milk as a Non-Starter Lactic Acid Bacterium 

### SALT

Important to stop the starter culture; dehydrate the rind to prevent microbial growth; drain the curds; coax white mold growth; flavor  
- Salt the curd  
- Add to the rind  
- Soak the cheese in brine

Water Activity  
Reduce water available for microorganisms by sequestering it with salt or sugar

Salt retaining decreases with increasing fat and whey drainage
